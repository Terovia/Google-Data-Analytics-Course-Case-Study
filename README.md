# Google Data Analytics Course Case Study
## Introduction
In the last course of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course, students are given the opportunity to complete a case study.  The aim of this case study is to provide students the ability to utilize the skills learned in the course and hopefully, kick start a Data Analysis career.

This case study focuses on applying the data analysis process: **ask, prepare, process, analyze, share,** and **act**. I am tasked to perform an analysis for a company called, Bellabeat.

## Scenario
I am a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart devicemarket. Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. I've been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights I discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. I will present my analysis to the Bellabeat executive team along with my high-level recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.
